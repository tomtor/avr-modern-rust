attiny402
=========

Rust project for the _attiny402_ (or _attiny1614_ or _avr128db28_ because these have compatible peripherals).

This uses the serial USART and flashes leds.

I will add code for the realtime counter.

## Build Instructions
1. Install prerequisites as described in the [`avr-hal` README] (`avr-gcc`, `avr-libc`, `avrdude`, [`ravedude`]).

2. Run `cargo build` to build the firmware.

3. Flash with the UPDI tool of your choice (see ./flash.sh)
